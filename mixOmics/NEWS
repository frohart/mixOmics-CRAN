Changes in 5.0-4
================

New features:

1- select.var.sgcca has been fixed (the outputs were messy)
2- minor bug in plotVar.sgcca and plotVar.rgcca fixed

Enhancements:
----------
1- network default color set to color.GreenRed




Changes in 5.0-3
================

Bug fixes:
----------
-the perf and predict functions have been updated. The prediction values are calculated based on the regression coefficients of Y onto the latent variables associated to X.

-scaling issues in perf/old-valid have been fixed

-one warning on the plotIndiv.rcc has been fixed.

-transition from valid() to perf() announced.

Changes in 5.0-2
================

New features:
-------------
- The valid function has been superseded by the perf function. Although similar in essence, few bugs have been fixed to estimate the performance of the sPLS and sPLS-DA models with no selection bias. A variable stability frequency has been added to the output. Functions spls.model and pls.model have been removed.

Bug fixes:
----------
-pls and spls function have been modified and harmonised w.r.t to scaling. Loading vectors a and b are now scaled to 1. Latent variables t and u are not scaled (following Table 21 of the Tenenhaus book - which is in French, sorry!).

-the argument abline.line has been set to FALSE by default in all plotIndiv functions.

- tune.multilevel for one factor has been fixed.

Changes in 5.0-1
================

New features:
-------------

New dependency to RGCCA package to enable integration of multiple matching data sets
- wrapping method wrapper.sgcca() and wrapper.rgcca() created

Multilevel analysis
- cross validation enabled in function tune.multilevel for one factor (previously, only loocv was available)

RCC
-the function estim.regul has been renamed tune.rcc
-the function pcatune has been renamed tune.pca

Bug fixes:
----------
-in plotIndiv: horizontal and vertical abline set as a default argument
-a new argument in splsda() function added: near.zero.var = TRUE or FALSE to speed up computations (near.zero.var = FALSE to gain speed)
-the valid() function has been updated to speed up the computations. There is no 'criterion' argument to choose anymore (by default, all are included in the computation)
-in plotVar: matching arguments user-function to avoid additions of unused arguments
-in plotIndiv, arguments 'x.label' and 'y.label' were replaced by 'X.label' and 'Y.label'
-in pca, argument 'scale.' was changed to 'scale'
