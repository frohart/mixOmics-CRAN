# ========================================================================================================
# block.spls: perform a horizontal PLS-DA on a combination of datasets, input as a list in X
# this function is a particular setting of internal_mint.block, the formatting of the input is checked in internal_wrapper.mint.block
# ========================================================================================================

# X: a list of data sets (called 'blocks') matching on the same samples. Data in the list should be arranged in samples x variables, with samples order matching in all data sets. \code{NA}s are not allowed.
# Y: outcome.
# indY: to supply if Y is missing, indicate the position of the outcome in the list X.
# ncomp: numeric vector of length the number of blocks in \code{X}. The number of components to include in the model for each block (does not necessarily need to take the same value for each block). By default set to 2 per block.
# keepX.constraint: A list of same length as X. Each entry keepX.constraint[[i]] is a list containing which variables of X[[i]] are to be kept on each of the first PLS-components
# keepY.constraint: Only used if Y is provided, otherwise extracted from keepX.constraint. A list containing which variables of Y are to be kept on each of the first PLS-components
# keepX: A vector of same length as X.  Each entry keepX[i] is the number of X[[i]]-variables kept in the model on the last components (once all keepX.constraint[[i]] are used).
# keepY: Only used if Y is provided. Each entry keepY[i] is the number of Y-variables kept in the model on the last components.
# design: the input design.
# scheme: the input scheme, one of "horst", "factorial" or ""centroid". Default to "centroid"
# mode: input mode, one of "canonical", "classic", "invariant" or "regression". Default to "regression"
# scale: boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero means and unit variances (default: TRUE).
# bias: boleean. A logical value for biaised or unbiaised estimator of the var/cov (defaults to FALSE).
# init: intialisation of the algorithm, one of "svd" or "svd.single". Default to "svd"
# tol: Convergence stopping value.
# verbose: if set to \code{TRUE}, reports progress on computing.
# max.iter: integer, the maximum number of iterations.
# near.zero.var: boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero values). Setting this argument to FALSE (when appropriate) will speed up the computations
