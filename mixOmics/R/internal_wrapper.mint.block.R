# perform the mint.pls on a subset of variables on one only dimension, deflate the intial matrices X and Y (already center by study)

# mean centering with attach and without modify.na, need to look at how to remove some of means/sigma when nearZerVar is used
# we can have a list of studies for Discriminant Analyses, not for pls/spls as they would be overlapping batch effects
