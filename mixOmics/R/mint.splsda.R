# ========================================================================================================
# mint.splsda: perform a vertical PLS on a combination of experiments, input as a matrix in X
# this function is a particular setting of internal_mint.block, the formatting of the input is checked in internal_wrapper.mint
# ========================================================================================================

# X: numeric matrix of predictors
# Y: a factor or a class vector for the discrete outcome
# ncomp: the number of components to include in the model. Default to 2.
# study: grouping factor indicating which samples are from the same study
# keepX.constraint: A list containing which variables of X are to be kept on each of the first PLS-components.
# keepX: number of \eqn{X} variables kept in the model on the last components (once all keepX.constraint[[i]] are used).
# scale: boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero means and unit variances (default: TRUE).
# tol: Convergence stopping value.
# max.iter: integer, the maximum number of iterations.
# near.zero.var: boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero values). Setting this argument to FALSE (when appropriate) will speed up the computations
