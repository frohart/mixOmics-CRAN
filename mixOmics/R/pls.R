# X: numeric matrix of predictors
# Y: numeric vector or matrix of responses
# ncomp: the number of components to include in the model. Default to 2.
# scale: boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero means and unit variances (default: TRUE).
# tol: Convergence stopping value.
# max.iter: integer, the maximum number of iterations.
# near.zero.var: boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero values). Setting this argument to FALSE (when appropriate) will speed up the computations
