\title{N-integration and feature selection with Projection to Latent Structures models (PLS) with sparse Discriminant Analysis}

\description{Integration of multiple data sets measured on the same samples or observations to classify a discrete outcome to classify a discrete outcome and select features from each data set, ie. N-integration with sparse Discriminant Analysis. The method is partly based on Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis.}



\usage{
block.splsda(X,
Y,
indY,
ncomp = 2,
keepX,
design,
scheme,
mode,
scale = TRUE,
init = "svd",
tol = 1e-06,
max.iter = 100,
near.zero.var = FALSE,
all.outputs = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
\item{X}{A list of data sets (called 'blocks') measured on the same samples. Data in the list should be arranged in matrices, samples x variables, with samples order matching in all data sets.}
\item{Y}{A factor or a class vector indicating the discrete outcome of each sample.}
\item{indY}{To be supplied if Y is missing, indicates the position of the factor / class vector outcome in the list \code{X}}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components to include in the model. Default to 2. Applies to all blocks.}
\item{keepX}{A list of same length as X.  Each entry is the number of variables to select in each of the blocks of X for each component. By default all variables are kept in the model.}
\item{design}{numeric matrix of size (number of blocks in X) x (number of blocks in X) with values between 0 and 1. Each value indicates the strenght of the relationship to be modelled between two blocks; a value of 0 indicates no relationship, 1 is the maximum value. If \code{Y} is provided instead of \code{indY}, the \code{design} matrix is changed to include relationships to \code{Y}. }
\item{scheme}{Either "horst", "factorial" or "centroid". Default = \code{horst}, see reference.}
\item{mode}{character string. What type of algorithm to use, (partially) matching
one of \code{"regression"}, \code{"canonical"}, \code{"invariant"} or \code{"classic"}.
See Details. Default = \code{regression}.}
\item{scale}{boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized
to zero means and unit variances. Default = \code{TRUE}.}
\item{init}{Mode of initialization use in the algorithm, either by Singular Value Decompostion of the product of each block of X with Y ("svd") or each block independently ("svd.single"). Default = \code{svd}.}
\item{tol}{Convergence stopping value.}
\item{max.iter}{integer, the maximum number of iterations.}
\item{near.zero.var}{boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero values). Default = \code{FALSE}.}
\item{all.outputs}{boolean. Computation can be faster when some specific (and non-essential) outputs are not calculated. Default = \code{TRUE}.}
}





\details{

\code{block.splsda} function fits a horizontal integration PLS-DA model with a specified number of components per block).
A factor indicating the discrete outcome needs to be provided, either by \code{Y} or by its position \code{indY} in the list of blocks \code{X}.

\code{X} can contain missing values. Missing values are handled by being disregarded during the cross product computations in the algorithm \code{block.pls} without having to delete rows with missing data. Alternatively, missing data can be imputed prior using the  \code{nipals} function.

The type of algorithm to use is specified with the \code{mode} argument. Four PLS
algorithms are available: PLS regression \code{("regression")}, PLS canonical analysis
\code{("canonical")}, redundancy analysis \code{("invariant")} and the classical PLS
algorithm \code{("classic")} (see References and \code{?pls} for more details).

Note that our method is partly based on sparse Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis and differs from the MB-PLS approaches proposed by Kowalski et al., 1989, J Chemom 3(1), Westerhuis et al., 1998, J Chemom, 12(5) and sparse variants Li et al., 2012, Bioinformatics 28(19); Karaman et al (2014), Metabolomics, 11(2);
Kawaguchi et al., 2017, Biostatistics.


Variable selection is performed on each component for each block of \code{X} if specified, via input parameter \code{keepX}.

\value{
\code{block.splsda} returns an object of class \code{"block.splsda", "block.spls"}, a list
that contains the following components:

\item{X}{the centered and standardized original predictor matrix.}
\item{indY}{the position of the outcome Y in the output list X.}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components included in the model for each block.}
\item{mode}{the algorithm used to fit the model.}
\item{keepX}{Number of variables used to build each component of each block}
\item{variates}{list containing the variates of each block of X.}
\item{loadings}{list containing the estimated loadings for the variates.}
\item{names}{list containing the names to be used for individuals and variables.}
\item{nzv}{list containing the zero- or near-zero predictors information.}
\item{iter}{Number of iterations of the algorthm for each component}
\item{weights}{Correlation between the variate of each block and the variate of the outcome. Used to weight predictions.}
\item{explained_variance}{Percentage of explained variance for each component and each block}
