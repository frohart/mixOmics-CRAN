\title{Vertical sparse Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) Regression}

\description{Integration of multilple data sets (or studies) matching on the same variables in the aim of classifying a discrete outcome, while selection features in each data set, ie. vertical sparse Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) regression.}

\usage{
mint.splsda(X,
Y,
ncomp = 2,
mode = c("regression", "canonical", "invariant", "classic"),
study,
keepX.constraint = NULL,
keepX = rep(ncol(X), ncomp),
scale = TRUE,
tol = 1e-06,
max.iter = 500,
near.zero.var = FALSE)

}

\arguments{
\item{X}{numeric matrix of predictors. \code{NA}s are allowed. Concatenation of multiple data sets matching on the same variables.}
\item{Y}{a factor or a class vector for the discrete outcome.}
\item{ncomp}{Number of components to include in the model (see Details). Default to 2}
\item{mode}{character string. What type of algorithm to use, (partially) matching
one of \code{"regression"} or \code{"canonical"}. See Details.}
\item{study}{grouping factor indicating which samples are from the same study (or data set)}
\item{keepX.constraint}{A list containing which variables of X are to be kept on each of the first PLS-components}
\item{keepX}{numeric vector of length \code{ncomp}, the number of variables
to keep in \eqn{X}-loadings. By default all variables are kept in the model.}
\item{scale}{boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized
to zero means and unit variances. Default = \code{TRUE}.}
\item{tol}{Convergence stopping value.}
\item{max.iter}{integer, the maximum number of iterations.}
\item{near.zero.var}{boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero values). Default = \code{FALSE}.}

}



\details{
\code{mint.splsda} function fits a vertical sPLS-DA models with \code{ncomp} components in which several studies matching on the same variables are integrated together in the aim of classifying a discrete outcome while selecting features. The grouping factor that indicates which samples are from which study is specified with \code{study}. We advise more than 3 samples per study where all outcome categories are represented.

The concatenated data matrix \code{X} can contain missing values. Missing values are handled by casewise deletion in the \code{mint.splsda} function without having to delete the rows with missing data.


The type of algorithm to use is specified with the \code{mode} argument. Four PLS
algorithms are available: PLS regression \code{("regression")}, PLS canonical analysis
\code{("canonical")}, redundancy analysis \code{("invariant")} and the classical PLS
algorithm \code{("classic")} (see References).


Variable selection is performed on each component of \code{X} via both input parameter \code{keepX.constraint} and \code{keepX} as follows. \code{keepX.constraint[[j]]} is a vector of variable names that indicates which variables to keep on component \code{j}; similarly, \code{keepX[k]} is a single positive value that indicates the number of variables to keep on component \code{length(keepX.constraint)+k}. See examples below.

Useful graphical outputs are available, e.g. \code{\link{plotIndiv}}, \code{\link{plotLoadings}}, \code{\link{plotVar}}.
