\usage{data(stemcells)}

\format{
A list containing the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{gene}}{data matrix with 167 rows and 400 columns. Each row represents
      an experimental sample, and each column a single gene.}
	\item{\code{celltype}}{a factor indicating the cell type of each sample.}
    \item{\code{study}}{a factor indicating the study from which the sample was extracted.}
  }
}

\details{
This data set contains the expression of a random subset of 400 genes in 167 samples from 6 independent studies and 3 cell types. Those studies can be combined and analysed using the MINT procedure.
