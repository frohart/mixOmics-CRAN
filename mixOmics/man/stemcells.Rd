\usage{data(stemcells)}

\format{
A list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{gene}}{data matrix with 125 rows and 400 columns. Each row represents
an experimental sample, and each column a single gene.}
\item{\code{celltype}}{a factor indicating the cell type of each sample.}
\item{\code{study}}{a factor indicating the study from which the sample was extracted.}
}
}

\details{
This data set contains the expression of a random subset of 400 genes in 125 samples from 4 independent studies and 3 cell types. Those studies can be combined and analysed using the MINT procedure.
