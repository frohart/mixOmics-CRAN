\title{Tuning function for block.splsda method (N-integration with sparse Discriminant Analysis)}

\description{
Computes M-fold or Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation scores based on a user-input
grid to determine the optimal parsity parameters values for method \code{block.splsda}.

validation = "Mfold",

\arguments{

\item{X}{numeric matrix of predictors. \code{NA}s are allowed.}
\item{Y}{\code{if(method = 'spls')} numeric vector or matrix of continuous responses (for multi-response models) \code{NA}s are allowed.}
\item{indY}{To be supplied if Y is missing, indicates the position of the matrix / vector response in the list \code{X}}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components to include in the model.}
\item{test.keepX}{A list of length the number of blocks in X (without the outcome). Each entry of this list is a numeric vector for the different keepX values to test for that specific block.}

\item{already.tested.X}{Optional, if \code{ncomp > 1} A numeric vector indicating the number of variables to select from the \eqn{X} data set on the firsts components.}

\item{validation}{character.  What kind of (internal) validation to use, matching one of \code{"Mfold"} or
\code{"loo"} (see below). Default is \code{"Mfold"}.}
\item{folds}{the folds in the Mfold cross-validation. See Details.}
\item{dist}{distance metric to use for \code{splsda} to estimate the classification error rate,
should be a subset of \code{"centroids.dist"}, \code{"mahalanobis.dist"} or \code{"max.dist"} (see Details).}
\item{measure}{Two misclassification measure are available: overall misclassification error \code{overall} or the Balanced Error Rate \code{BER}}
\item{weighted}{tune using either the performance of the Majority vote or the Weighted vote.}
\item{progressBar}{by default set to \code{TRUE} to output the progress bar of the computation.}
\item{tol}{Convergence stopping value.}
\item{max.iter}{integer, the maximum number of iterations.}
\item{near.zero.var}{boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero values). Default value is FALSE}
\item{nrepeat}{Number of times the Cross-Validation process is repeated.}
\item{design}{numeric matrix of size (number of blocks in X) x (number of blocks in X) with 0 or 1 values. A value of 1 (0) indicates a relationship (no relationship) between the blocks to be modelled. If \code{Y} is provided instead of \code{indY}, the \code{design} matrix is changed to include relationships to \code{Y}. }
\item{scheme}{Either "horst", "factorial" or "centroid". Default = \code{centroid}, see reference.}
\item{scale}{boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized
to zero means and unit variances. Default = \code{TRUE}.}
\item{init}{Mode of initialization use in the algorithm, either by Singular Value Decompostion of the product of each block of X with Y ("svd") or each block independently ("svd.single"). Default = \code{svd}.}
\item{light.output}{if set to FALSE, the prediction/classification of each sample for each of \code{test.keepX} and each comp is returned.}
\item{cpus}{Number of cpus to use when running the code in parallel.}
\item{name.save}{character string for the name of the file to be saved.}

}

\details{


This tuning function should be used to tune the keepX parameters in the \code{block.splsda} function (N-integration with sparse Discriminant Analysis).

M-fold or LOO cross-validation is performed with stratified subsampling where all classes are represented in each fold.

If \code{validation = "Mfold"}, M-fold cross-validation is performed.
The number of folds to generate is to be specified in the argument \code{folds}.

If \code{validation = "loo"}, leave-one-out cross-validation is performed. By default \code{folds} is set to the number of unique individuals.

All combination of test.keepX values are tested. A message informs how many will be fitted on each component for a given test.keepX.

More details about the prediction distances in \code{?predict}. More details about the PLS modes in \code{?pls}.
}

\value{
A list that contains:
\item{error.rate}{returns the prediction error for each \code{test.keepX} on each component, averaged across all repeats and subsampling folds. Standard deviation is also output. All error rates are also available as a list.}
\item{choice.keepX}{returns the number of variables selected (optimal keepX) on each component, for each block.}
\item{choice.ncomp}{returns the optimal number of components for the model fitted with \code{$choice.keepX}. }
\item{error.rate.class}{returns the error rate for each level of \code{Y} and for each component computed with the optimal keepX}

\item{predict}{Prediction values for each sample, each \code{test.keepX}, each comp and each repeat. Only if light.output=FALSE}
\item{class}{Predicted class for each sample, each \code{test.keepX}, each comp and each repeat. Only if light.output=FALSE}

\item{cor.value}{compute the correlation between latent variables for two-factor sPLS-DA analysis.}
