\details{

This tuning function should be used to tune the parameters in the \code{splsda} function (number of components and number of variables in \code{keepX} to select).

For a sPLS-DA, M-fold or LOO cross-validation is performed with stratified subsampling where all classes are represented in each fold.

If \code{validation = "loo"}, leave-one-out cross-validation is performed. By default \code{folds} is set to the number of unique individuals.

The function outputs the optimal number of components that achieve the best performance based on the overall error rate or BER. The assessment is data-driven and similar to the process detailed in (Rohart et al., 2016), where one-sided t-tests assess whether there is a gain in performance when adding a component to the model. Our experience has shown that in most case, the optimal number of components is the number of categories in \code{Y} - 1.


For sPLS-DA multilevel one-factor analysis, M-fold or LOO cross-validation is performed where all repeated measurements of one sample are in the same fold. Note that logratio transform and the multilevel analysis are performed internally and independently on the training and test set.

For a sPLS-DA multilevel two-factor analysis, the correlation between components from the within-subject variation of X and the \code{cond} matrix is computed on the whole data set. The reason why we cannot obtain a cross-validation error rate as for the spls-DA one-factor analysis is because of the dififculty to decompose and predict the within matrices within each fold.

For a sPLS two-factor analysis a sPLS canonical mode is run, and the correlation between components from the within-subject variation of X and Y is computed on the whole data set.

If \code{validation = "Mfold"}, M-fold cross-validation is performed. 
How many folds to generate is selected by specifying the number of folds in \code{folds}.


If \code{auc = TRUE} and there are more than 2 categories in \code{Y}, the Area Under the Curve is averaged using one-vs-all comparison. Note however that the AUC criteria may not be particularly insightful as the prediction threshold we use in sPLS-DA differs from an AUC threshold (sPLS-DA relies on prediction distances for predictions, see \code{?predict.splsda} for more details).

More details about the prediction distances in \code{?predict} and the referred publication.

\value{
Depending on the type of analysis performed, a list that contains:
\item{error.rate}{returns the prediction error for each \code{test.keepX} on each component, averaged across all repeats and subsampling folds. Standard deviation is also output. All error rates are also available as a list.}
\item{choice.keepX}{returns the number of variables selected (optimal keepX) on each component.}
\item{choice.ncomp}{returns the optimal number of components for the model fitted with \code{$choice.keepX} }
\item{error.rate.class}{returns the error rate for each level of \code{Y} and for each component computed with the optimal keepX}

\item{predict}{Prediction values for each sample, each \code{test.keepX}, each comp and each repeat. Only if light.output=FALSE}
\item{class}{Predicted class for each sample, each \code{test.keepX}, each comp and each repeat. Only if light.output=FALSE}

\item{auc}{AUC mean and standard deviation if the number of categories in \code{Y} is greater than 2, see details above. Only if auc = TRUE}

\item{cor.value}{only if multilevel analysis with 2 factors: correlation between latent variables.}

# 5 components, optimising 'keepX' and 'ncomp'

folds = 10, dist = "max.dist", nrepeat = 5, progressBar = TRUE)

## only tune component 3 and 4
# keeping 5 and 10 variables on the first two components respectively
