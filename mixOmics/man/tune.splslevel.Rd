\title{Tuning functions for multilevel sPLS method}

\description{
For a multilevel spls analysis, the tuning criterion is based on the maximisation of the correlation between the components from both data sets
}

\usage{
tune.splslevel(X, Y, multilevel, ncomp = NULL,
mode = "regression",
test.keepX = rep(ncol(X), ncomp),
test.keepY = rep(ncol(Y), ncomp),
already.tested.X = NULL,
already.tested.Y = NULL)

}	

\arguments{
\item{X}{numeric matrix of predictors. \code{NA}s are allowed.}
\item{Y}{\code{if(method = 'spls')} numeric vector or matrix of continuous responses (for multi-response models) \code{NA}s are allowed.}
\item{multilevel}{Design matrix for multilevel analysis (for repeated measurements) that indicates the repeated measures on each individual, i.e. the individuals ID. See Details.}
\item{ncomp}{the number of components to include in the model.}
\item{mode}{character string. What type of algorithm to use, (partially) matching
one of \code{"regression"}, \code{"canonical"}, \code{"invariant"} or \code{"classic"}.}
\item{test.keepX}{numeric vector for the different number of variables to test from the \eqn{X} data set}
\item{test.keepY}{numeric vector for the different number of variables to test from the \eqn{Y} data set}
\item{already.tested.X}{Optional, if \code{ncomp > 1} A numeric vector indicating the number of variables to select from the \eqn{X} data set on the firsts components.}
\item{already.tested.Y}{Optional, if \code{ncomp > 1} A numeric vector indicating the number of variables to select from the \eqn{Y} data set on the firsts components.}
