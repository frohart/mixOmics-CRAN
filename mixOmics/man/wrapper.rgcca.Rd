\title{mixOmics wrapper for Regularised Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis (rgcca)}

\description{Wrapper function to perform Regularized Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis (rGCCA), a generalised approach for the integration of multiple datasets. For more details, see the \code{help(rgcca)} from the \pkg{RGCCA} package.
}

\usage{	
wrapper.rgcca(X,
    design = 1 - diag(length(X)),
    tau = rep(1, length(X)),
    ncomp = rep(1, length(X)),
    keepX.constraint,
    keepX,
    scheme = "centroid",
    mode="canonical",
    scale = TRUE,
    bias = FALSE,
    init = "svd.single",
    tol = .Machine$double.eps,
    verbose = FALSE,
    max.iter=1000,
    near.zero.var = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{X}{a list of data sets (called 'blocks') matching on the same samples. Data in the list should be arranged in samples x variables. \code{NA}s are not allowed.}
  \item{design}{numeric matrix of size (number of blocks) x (number of blocks) with only 0 or 1 values. A value of 1 (0) indicates a relationship (no relationship) between the blocks to be modelled using sGCCA.}
  \item{tau}{numeric vector of length the number of blocks in \code{X}. Each regularization parameter will be applied on each block and takes the value between 0 (no regularisation) and 1. If tau = "optimal" the shrinkage paramaters are estimated for each block and
  each dimension using the Schafer and Strimmer (2005)
  analytical formula.}
  \item{ncomp}{numeric vector of length the number of blocks in \code{X}. The number of components to include in the model for each block (does not necessarily takes the same value for each block).}
\item{keepX.constraint}{A list of same length as X. Each entry keepX.constraint[[i]] is a list containing which variables of X[[i]] are to be kept on each of the first PLS-components}
\item{keepX}{ A vector of same length as X.  Each entry keepX[i] is the number of X[[i]]-variables kept in the model on the last components (once all keepX.constraint[[i]] are used).}
  \item{scheme}{Either "horst", "factorial" or "centroid"
  (Default: "centroid").}
\item{mode}{character string. What type of algorithm to use, (partially) matching
one of \code{"regression"}, \code{"canonical"}, \code{"invariant"} or \code{"classic"}.
See Details.}
\item{scale}{boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized
to zero means and unit variances (default: TRUE)}
\item{bias}{boleean. A logical value for biaised or unbiaised estimator of the var/cov (defaults to FALSE).}
\item{init}{Mode of initialization use in the algorithm, either by Singular Value Decompostion of the product of each block of X with Y ("svd") or each block independently ("svd.single") . Default to "svd".}
\item{tol}{Convergence stopping value.}
\item{verbose}{if set to \code{TRUE}, reports progress on computing.}
\item{max.iter}{integer, the maximum number of iterations.}
\item{near.zero.var}{boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero values). Setting this argument to FALSE (when appropriate) will speed up the computations. Default value is FALSE}
}


\details{
	This wrapper function performs rGCCA (see \pkg{RGCCA}) with \eqn{1, \ldots ,}\code{ncomp} components on each block data set.
	A supervised or unsupervised model can be run. For a supervised model, the \code{\link{unmap}} function should be used as an input data set.
	More details can be found on the package \pkg{RGCCA}.
}

\value{

  \item{loadings}{the loadings for each block data set (outer wieght vector).}
  \item{loadings.star}{the laodings, standardised.}
  \item{tau}{the input tau parameter.}
  \item{scheme}{the input schme.}
  \item{ncomp}{the number of components on each block.}

  \item{AVE}{Indicators of model quality based on the
  Average Variance Explained (AVE): AVE(for one block),
  AVE(outer model), AVE(inner model)..}
  \item{names}{list containing the names to be used for individuals and variables.}
